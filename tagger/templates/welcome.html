  <p class="lead">This project, codename "Nocturnal Retriever", is an attempt to create an open-source web-based document tagging tool for qualitative data analysis.</p>
  <p>Using this tool, you can upload a collection of documents, create a hierarchy of tags, and annotate portions of documents with tags and notes that you can recall and organize later.</p>

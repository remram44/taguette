  <h2>About <span style="font-family: BadScript;">TAGUETTE</span></h2>

  <p>A spin on the phrase "tag it!", <a href="https://www.taguette.org/">Taguette</a> is a free and open source qualitative research tool (which works on all operating systems!) that allows users to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Import PDFs, Word Docs (.docx), Text files (.txt), HTML, EPUB, MOBI, Open Documents (.odt), and Rich Text Files (.rtf).</li>
    <li>Highlight words, sentences, or paragraphs and tag them with the codes *you* create.</li>
    <li>Work collaboratively with other users (if <a href="self-host.html">self-hosting</a> or using <a href="https://app.taguette.org">app.taguette.org</a>).</li>
    <li>Export tagged documents, highlights for a specific tag, highlights for all tags, and a list of tags with their descriptions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>...and much more! You can view our development queue on GitLab here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/remram44/taguette/-/issues">https://gitlab.com/remram44/taguette/-/issues</a>. You can always add feature requests, bug reports, or general feedback via GitLab issues.

  <h3>Why did we make Taguette?</h3>

  <p>Qualitative methods generate rich, detailed research materials that leave individuals’ perspectives intact  as well as provide multiple contexts for understanding phenomenon under study. Qualitative methods are used by a wide range of fields, such as anthropology, education, nursing, psychology, sociology, and marketing. Qualitative data has a similarly wide range: observations, interviews, documents, audiovisual materials, and more.</p>

  <p>However - the software options for qualitative researchers are either <strong>far too expensive</strong>, don't allow for the seminal method of highlighting and tagging materials, <em>or actually perform quantitative analysis</em>, just on text.</p>

  <p><strong>It's not right or fair that qualitative researchers without massive research funds cannot afford the basic software to do their research.</strong></p>

  <p>So, to bolster a fair and equitable entry into qualitative methods, we've made Taguette!</p>

  <h3 id="team">The Team</h3>

  <p>Taguette was developed by Rémi Rampin. Vicky Steeves and Sarah DeMott provided the functional requirements, user needs, and testing in order to influence the development process.</p>
